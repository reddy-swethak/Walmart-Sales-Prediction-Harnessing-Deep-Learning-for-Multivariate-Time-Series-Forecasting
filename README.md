## 1. Problem Statement
The aim of the Walmart Sales Predictor project is to develop accurate forecasting models for predicting sales across various departments in Walmart stores. By leveraging deep learning techniques for multivariate time series forecasting, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into future sales trends. The predictions generated by these models can assist Walmart in optimizing inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic decision-making processes.

## 2. Introduction
In today's retail landscape, accurate sales forecasting is essential for ensuring efficient operations and maximizing profitability. Walmart, being one of the world's largest retailers, faces the challenge of predicting sales across its numerous stores and departments accurately. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to capture the complex patterns and dependencies present in retail sales data. Therefore, this project explores the use of advanced deep learning techniques to develop robust predictive models capable of handling the intricacies of multivariate time series data.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data from Walmart stores spanning multiple years. It includes information such as store IDs, department IDs, dates, and weekly sales figures. Additionally, the dataset incorporates various external factors that may influence sales, such as holiday events, temperature, fuel prices, and unemployment rates. This rich source of data provides a comprehensive foundation for building predictive models that can effectively capture the underlying patterns and relationships within the sales data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before proceeding with model development, thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and structure. EDA involves visualizing the data, identifying trends, seasonality, correlations, and outliers. It also includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables. By understanding the nuances of the data through EDA, we can better prepare the dataset for model training and validation.

## Models Implemented
### 1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
ARIMA is a classical time series forecasting model that captures the linear dependencies between observations and their lagged values. It is well-suited for modeling stationary time series data and can be effective in capturing short-term sales trends.

### 2. SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
SARIMA extends the capabilities of ARIMA by incorporating seasonal components into the model. It is particularly useful for datasets with strong seasonal patterns, allowing for more accurate long-term sales forecasts.

### 3. Prophet
Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook that is specifically designed to handle time series data with strong seasonal effects. It utilizes an additive model that decomposes the time series into trend, seasonality, and holiday components. Prophet is capable of capturing complex patterns in retail sales data and providing accurate forecasts even in the presence of irregularities.

### 4. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for sequential data like time series. LSTM networks can capture long-term dependencies in the data and are capable of learning complex patterns over extended time periods. By incorporating LSTM networks into our forecasting models, we can leverage their ability to capture temporal dynamics and improve the accuracy of our sales predictions.

### 5. Exponential Smoothing
Exponential smoothing is a popular method for time series forecasting that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations. This technique is particularly useful for capturing short-term fluctuations and trends in the data. By applying exponential smoothing to our sales data, we can generate smooth and robust forecasts that adapt to changes in the underlying patterns over time.
